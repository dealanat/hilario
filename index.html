        <h1>Lawyer</h1>
        <h2>by: Hilario Brillantes</h2>
    </header>
    <p>As a future lawyer, I will focus on being faithful to the truth. I am here to make a significant impact. When people say lawyers help victims, they don't just mean victims of "big" crimes; they also mean victims of events happening even inside schools. I can offer my help; being a lawyer means I should know the constitution and be able to discern what is right and wrong. I have the capacity to make social change; please trust me when I say that we are capable of creating social change.</p>
